# coexIV

Reproductible analyses supporting the idea that intraspecific variability is mainly due to environmental heterogeneity and does not blur species niche differences nor slow down competitive exclusion.

These analyses are associated with an article (*Rethinking the role of intraspecific variability in species coexistence*, Girard-Tercieux *et al.* 2021).

In order to execute the analyses, use the make.R file. The analyses are organised in a research compendium and therefore some functions and a package name need to be loaded.
To look directly at the code, open the Rmd files in the folder "analyses". They contain all the code for Appendix 1 and 2, and call functions that are in the "R" and "C" folders for Appendix 3.
The Appendices are also available in pdf format in the folder "analyses".
The figures are available in png format in the folder "outputs", "analysis_x", "figures".
