## Perfect knowledge model: generating response values.

We fixed the species parameters of the "Perfect knowledge model” as follows (see main text, Eq. 1), using 10 environmental variables ($N$=10):

Parameters of species 1:  $\beta_0$ = `r par_sp[1,1]`, $\beta_1$ = `r par_sp[2,1]`, $\beta_2$ to $\beta_{6}$ were chosen randomly between -0.05 and 0.05 and $\beta_{7}$ to $\beta_{10}$ were chosen randomly between 0 and 0.05.

Parameters of species 2:  $\beta_0$ = `r par_sp[1,2]`, $\beta_1$ = `r par_sp[2,2]`, $\beta_2$ to $\beta_{10}$ were chosen the same way as for species 1.

The difference between the species was imposed by those parameters. Here, species 1 was more competitive on average thanks to its higher intercept ($\beta_0$) and response to the first environmental variable ($\beta_1$) (see main text, Fig. 3).
The first environmental variable ($X_1$) had a higher weight in the computation of the response variable, as would be the most limiting factor for the response variable.

To account for intrinsic variability in our generated data, we added variability in species parameters by sampling each individual parameter in a normal distribution centered on the species mean parameter and with a standard deviation of a quarter of the species mean parameter.

To represent the spatialized environment, we built a 2D matrix of dimension `r dim1` $\times$ `r dim2` for each environmental variable at a time $t_0$, by randomly generating them with spatial autocorrelation. Each variable was independently simulated by using the gstat R package [@pebesma_multivariable_2004 ; @graler_spatio-temporal_2016], enabling to create autocorrelated random fields. A spherical semivariogram model was used for each of the ten environmental variables, with a mean of 0 for each explanatory variable (beta = 0), a sill of 1 (psill = 1) for each and a range of 50 (range = 50).

We then considered that $Y$ had been measured at two times, $t_0$ and $t_1$, for each individual. A pair of coordinates within this spatialized environment was randomly assigned to each of the `r nind` individuals. We considered that some of the environmental variables (light, temperature, humidity, nutrient availability for instance) had changed between $t_0$ and $t_1$ and others had not (slope, altitude for instance). For the first environmental variable which had a stronger impact on $Y$ values and another randomly drawn environmental variable, we computed values at $t_1$ as $t_0 + \epsilon$, $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.1)$ (they randomly increased or decreased). For two other environmental variables randomly drawn, $X_{t_1} = X_{t_0} + |\epsilon|, \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.1)$ (they increase) and for two other environmental variables, $X_{t_1} = X_{t_0} - |\epsilon|, \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.1)$ (they decreased).

This led to two repeated measurements of $Y$ for each individual of each species, i.e. `r nobs` values of $Y_{i,j,t}$, with $i=[1;2]$ ; $j=[1,50]$ ; $t=[t_0;t_1]$.

Figure \@ref(fig:HistogramsGrowth) shows the distribution of the simulated $Y$ data and figure \@ref(fig:PlotsXY) shows the relationship between $X_1$ and $Y$.

## Partial knowledge model: interpreting the response values with only one explanatory variable.

We ran the model (see main text, Eq. 2) twice, with the datasets generated with and without intrinsic IV.

We visualized the convergence and the results of the models thanks to trace and density plots.

We inferred a high IV even in the absence of intrinsic IV (Table \@ref(tab:EstimateTable)). 

```{r PlotIntrinsicIV, fig.cap="Plot of the real values - points - and estimated mean - bold lines - and 95\\% confidence interval - thin lines - of $Y$ versus $X_1$. The dashed lines correspond to the 95\\% interval due to intrinsic IV."}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("outputs", "theoretical_model", "figures", "Partial_knowledge_model_genetic_var.png"))
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:PlotIntrinsicIV) the bold and solid (dashed) lines represent the mean rate of the response variable (e.g. growth) of Species 1 (blue) and Species 2 (orange) as computed with the parameters retrieved from the model without (with) intrinsic IV respectively. The plain lines represent the 95% interval of the posteriors from the model without intrinsic IV and the dashed lines show the 95% confidence interval of the posteriors from the model with intrinsic IV. Figure \@ref(fig:PlotIntrinsicIV) shows that intrinsic IV simply increases the overlap between the response of Species 1 and Species 2.

## Spatial autocorrelation of individual response

To test for spatial autocorrelation of individual response, we computed Moran’s I test using the Moran.I function of the ape R package [@paradis_ape_2019].


```{r MoranTable}

load(here::here("outputs", "theoretical_model", "Moran_I_theoretical_model.RData"))

                            full_width = F)
```


## Similarity between conspecific individuals compared to heterospecific individuals and consequences for species coexistence.

We used semivariograms to visualise the spatial autocorrelation of the response variable and to test whether the individual response was more similar within conspecifics than within heterospecifics.
The semivariograms were computed and modelled with the variogram and the fit.variogram functions of the gstat R package ([@pebesma_multivariable_2004, @graler_spatio-temporal_2016]) respectively. The variogram models were spherical.

## Data and preliminary analysis

The experimental design aimed at minimizing environmental variations and selected productive genotypes able to accommodate several environmental conditions [@le_maire_light_2019].

Mean annual growth of each tree in mm/y was computed as the DBH (Diameter at Breast Height) difference between two consecutive censuses divided by the time between the two censuses. In case of mortality of the tree between two censuses, the data was discarded. We computed the neperian logarithm of diameter and growth (with a constant for growth in order to avoid undefined values).

```{r PlotsGrowthLight, fig.cap="Growth (after removing data after mortality) before (a) and after (b) log-transformation.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("outputs", "clonal_analysis", "figures", "Histograms_Raw_Data.png"))

```

Figure \@ref(fig:PlotsGrowthLight) shows the distribution of growth data before and after log-transformation.

```{r Coordinates, fig.cap="Design of a plot. Each point is a tree and the associated number is the tag of the tree."}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("outputs", "clonal_analysis", "figures", "Plot_design.png")) 

```

Figure \@ref(fig:Coordinates) shows the disposition of the trees in a single plot. There are 14 genotypes times 10 repetitions, so 140 plots with this same design.

```{r PlotColoursDate, fig.cap="Plot of the growth versus the diameter. Each colour represents a tree age."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("outputs", "clonal_analysis", "figures", "Raw_data.png")) 
```

Figure \@ref(fig:PlotColoursDate) shows the age of the trees has a big influence on the values of growth but also on the relationship between growth and diameter: the slope is smaller with time, indicating that for the same diameter, growth is slower through time. This is likely an effect of competition for light and possibly underground resources, since as the trees grow their capacity to capture resources increases.
Therefore, we computed a competition index $C_{i,t}$ to integrate this effect in the growth model. The competition index was computed for each tree which is not on the edge of a plot. It was the sum of the basal areas (BA) of the 8 direct neighbours (there was no need to divide by the area of the rectangle that comprises all the direct neighbours, since this latter is a constant by construction of the experimental design). It was then log-transformed. Dead neighbours were considered as having a null BA.


$C_{i, t} = \sum BA_{neighbours(i, t)}$

```

Figures \@ref(fig:TracePosteriors) to \@ref(fig:SpatialRandomEffects) illustrate the convergence of the model.

Figure \@ref(fig:PlotsRanef) shows mean values and 95% confidence intervals of random effects (except individual random effects which are too many), enabling to graphically look for a tendency.

## Datasets

### Paracou

```{r ChargeParacou, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Paracou <- coexIV::read_data_paracou()
Paracou <- coexIV::rename_indet_paracou(Paracou) %>% coexIV::create_identspecies()
```

The Paracou forest is located in French Guiana. It is one of the best-studied lowland tropical forests in the Guiana Shield region. It belongs to the Caesalpiniaceae facies and has amongst the highest alpha-diversity in the Guiana shield with 150-200 tree species per hectare in inventories of trees with DBH $\ge$ 10 cm. The Guiana Shield is characterized by Pre-Cambrian granitic and metamorphic geological formations, highly eroded. It is associated with gently undulating landscapes and a very dense hydrographic system. Paracou forest lies in a hilly area, on a formation called “série Armina” characterized by schists and sandstones and locally crossed by veins of pegmatite, aplite and quartz. The topography of the site consists of small hills separated by narrow (< 5 m wide) sandy waterbeds. The altitude varies from 5 to about 45 m above sea level [@gourlet-fleury_ecology_2004, @herault_key_2018]. The mean annual temperature is 26 °C and winds are generally weak. There is a well marked dry season (from mid-August to mid-November) and a long rain season with a short drier period between March and April (mean annual rainfall of 3,041 mm). Different study programs have been led at the Paracou site (https://paracou.cirad.fr/).
Here, we used data from a disturbance experiment, where 12 square plots of 6.25 ha were exposed to four different logging intensities between 1986 and 1988, as well as four square plots of 6.25 ha which were set up for biodiversity monitoring in 1990-1992 (plots 1-15). Since then, cartesian coordinates, DBH, species identity and survival of each tree with a DBH $\ge$ 10 cm have been collected every one or two years, during the dry season (mid-August to mid-November).
The studied 93.75-ha area harbors `r length(unique(Paracou$idTree))` measured trees, among which `r length(unique(Paracou[which(Paracou$Sp=="Indet_sp"),]$idTree))` belong to an undetermined species and others belong to `r length(unique(Paracou$Sp))-1` determined species, `r length(unique(Paracou$Genus))-1` genera and `r length(unique(Paracou$Family))` families.

```{r RemoveYearsParacou}
Paracou <- Paracou[which(!(Paracou$CensusYear %in% c(1985:1991))),]
```

We removed all measures of the years before the perturbations were performed and the biodiversity plots were added (1985-1991), thus obtaining a dataset containing `r length(unique(Paracou$idTree))` measured trees, among which `r length(unique(Paracou[which(Paracou$Sp=="Indet_sp"),]$idTree))` belong to an undetermined species and others belong to `r length(unique(Paracou$Sp))-1` determined species, `r length(unique(Paracou$Genus))-1` genera and `r length(unique(Paracou$Family))` families.

Figure \@ref(fig:IncludePlotParacou) shows the location of the used trees in the Paracou site.

Species_list_Uppangala$Genus <- stringr::str_split_fixed(Species_list_Uppangala$LatinName, " ", 2)[,1]

upsp.dataset$Sp <- Species_list_Uppangala$LatinName[match(upsp.dataset$SpCode, Species_list_Uppangala$SpCode)]

upsp.dataset$Genus <- Species_list_Uppangala$Genus[match(upsp.dataset$SpCode, Species_list_Uppangala$SpCode)]

upsp.dataset$Family <- Species_list_Uppangala$Family[match(upsp.dataset$SpCode, Species_list_Uppangala$SpCode)]
```

The Uppangala Permanent Sample Plot (UPSP) is located in South-East Asia, in the Western Ghats of India, and was established in 1989 by the French Institute of Pondicherry in the Kadamakal Reserve Forest, in the Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary, in Karnataka state, India [@pelissier_tree_2011]. It is a low altitude (500-600 m) wet evergreen monsoon Dipterocarp forest [@bec_characterizing_2015]. This forest is considered as one of the rare undisturbed tropical forests in the world [@pascal_structure_1996].
The studied area of 5.07 ha is quite steep, with a mean slope angle of about 30–35°. The plots consist in five North–South oriented transects that are 20-m wide, 180- to 370-m long, and 100-m apart center to center, in addition to three rectangular plots which overlap the transects. The transects gather data from 1990 to 2011 and the rectangular plots from 1993 to 2011. The trees with GBH (Girth at Breast Height) $\ge$ 30 cm (equivalent to ca. 9.5 cm DBH) were measured every 3 to 5 years. The original dataset contains measurements of `r length(unique(upsp.dataset$TreeID))` trees of `r length(unique(upsp.dataset$SpCode))` species (including 2 morphospecies),`r length(unique(upsp.dataset$Genus))` genera and `r length(unique(upsp.dataset$Family))` families.

We removed the census dates which were not common for all plots (1990-1992).

```{r RemoveYearsUppangala, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
upsp.dataset <- upsp.dataset[which(upsp.dataset$date>1339),]
```

Thus, we obtained a dataset containing `r length(unique(upsp.dataset$TreeID))` trees of `r length(unique(upsp.dataset$SpCode))` species (including 2 morphospecies),`r length(unique(upsp.dataset$Genus))` genera and `r length(unique(upsp.dataset$Family))` families.

The Barro Colorado Island site is located in central America, in Panama, covered by a lowland tropical moist forest. The zone became an island after a valley was flooded in order to build the Panama Canal, in 1913. It is nowadays considered as the most intensively studied tropical forest in the world. The studied site is a 50 ha plot (500 $\times$ 1,000 m). It has an elevation of 120 m and is quite flat (most slopes are gentler than 10°). Complete censuses of all trees with DBH $\ge$ 1 cm have been performed every 5 years since 1980. The dataset contains measurements of `r length(unique(BCI$treeID))` trees of `r length(unique(BCI$sp))` tree species, `r length(unique(BCI$Genus))` genera and `r length(unique(BCI$Family))` families.

```{r RemoveValuesBCI, include=FALSE}
BCI <- BCI[is.na(BCI$dbh)==F,]#remove NA
BCI <- BCI[which(BCI$dbh>=100),]#remove trees with DBH < 10cm (for consistance with the other datasets)
```

When only taking into account trees with DBH $\ge$ 10 cm for consistency with the other datasets, it contains measurements of `r length(unique(BCI$treeID))` trees of `r length(unique(BCI$sp))` tree species, `r length(unique(BCI$Genus))` genera and `r length(unique(BCI$Family))` families.
The dataset is available in [@condit_complete_2019].

For the Paracou site, after removing `r nrow(Paracou_no_mean[which(Paracou_no_mean$Sp=="Indet_sp"),])` growth estimates for `r length(unique(Paracou_no_mean[which(Paracou_no_mean$Sp=="Indet_sp"),]$idTree))` trees of indeterminate species, we obtained a dataset with `r nrow(Paracou_no_mean[which(Paracou_no_mean$Sp!="Indet_sp"),])` growth estimates for `r length(unique(Paracou_no_mean[which(Paracou_no_mean$Sp!="Indet_sp"),]$idTree))` trees of `r length(unique(Paracou_no_mean[which(Paracou_no_mean$Sp!="Indet_sp"),]$Sp))` species.

For the Uppangala site, we obtained a dataset with `r nrow(Uppangala_no_mean)` growth estimates for `r length(unique(Uppangala_no_mean$TreeID))` trees of `r length(unique(Uppangala_no_mean$SpCode))` species.

For the BCI site, we obtained a dataset with `r nrow(BCI_no_mean)` growth estimates for `r length(unique(BCI_no_mean$treeID))` trees of `r length(unique(BCI_no_mean$sp))` species.

## Estimation of IV

We evaluated the convergence of the model using trace and density plots of the posterior estimates.

## Spatial analyses

"Most abundant species" are species with more than 3,000 individuals.

## Spatial autocorrelation in undisturbed plots in the Paracou site

One of our main hypotheses was that since many environmental variables are spatially structured and that tree growth is largely influenced by environmental variables, tree growth should be spatially structured. Our analysis using Moran’s I test showed that tree growth was indeed spatially structured at our study sites. The Paracou dataset offers the opportunity to test this hypothesis further. Indeed, some plots were disturbed in the early eighties, creating artificial gaps, whereas others were not disturbed. As the creation of gaps results in a strong spatial structure of the light available under the canopy, we hypothesized that growth should be less structured in plots that were not disturbed.

```{r ResultsMoranParacouUndisturbed}

load(here::here("outputs", "tropical_analysis", "Results_moran.RData"))
load(here::here("outputs", "tropical_analysis", "Results_moran_undisturbed.RData"))

kableExtra::kbl(Results_moran_undisturbed, booktabs = T, caption = "Spatial autocorrelation of the growth of conspecific individuals in the undisturbed plots of the Paracou site. Shown are the proportion of species, and of corresponding individuals, in \\%, for which individual growth was significantly spatially autocorrelated, or not significantly spatially autocorrelated. The spatial autocorrelation of individual growth was tested using Moran’s I index.")%>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position", full_width = FALSE))
```

Considering the undisturbed plots only, the proportion of individuals of species with a significant Moran’s I test was `r round(as.numeric(Results_moran_undisturbed[2,2]))`%, much lower than when including the disturbed plots (`r round(as.numeric(Results_moran[2,2]))`%, see main text, Table 3; Table \@ref(tab:ResultsMoranParacouUndisturbed)). This corroborates our hypothesis that  the openness of the canopy triggered important spatial structure in disturbed plots due to light gaps, and as in these gaps, trees tend to grow faster, the spatial structure of growth is stronger.

## Spatial autocorrelation in BCI using smaller stems

In order to be able to compare all three datasets together, we removed all stems that had a DBH inferior to 10 cm in the BCI inventories, which include all stems with DBH $\ge$ 1 cm.  We replicated our analysis on the spatial autocorrelation of tree growth in the complete dataset and found that the spatial structure in individual growth was even more significant.

## Variance comparison using a sample

```{r ResultsVarianceComparisonSample}
load(here::here("outputs", "tropical_analysis", "Results_var_comp_sample.RData"))

Results_var_comp_sample %>%
  dplyr::mutate_all(kableExtra::linebreak) %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE, caption="Comparison of local intra- and interspecific variability in individual growth for three tropical forest sites, when controlling for species abundance. See main text. Semivariances with heterospecifics were here computed by sampling a maximum of 10 individuals per species.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position", "scale_down"),
                full_width = F) %>%
  kableExtra::pack_rows("Paracou", start_row = 1, end_row = 2) %>% 
  kableExtra::pack_rows("Uppangala", start_row = 3, end_row = 4)%>%
  kableExtra::pack_rows("BCI", start_row = 5, end_row = 6)%>%
  kableExtra::column_spec(2:4, width="3cm")

```

To control for a potential effect of species abundance on the values of semivariances with heterospecifics, we replicated the analysis (see main text, Table 4) by computing the semivariances with heterospecifics by sampling a maximum of ten individuals per species. The results were qualitatively unchanged (Table \@ref(tab:ResultsVarianceComparisonSample)).
